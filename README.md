The Automated Badminton Booking Tool is an automated tool that scrapes data from a given website (pre chosen for personal use), scrapes data to output available slots, and books courts to play badminton!

This tool has been created entirely for non commercial, private use to save the creator (me) a 5-10 minutes every week when trying to book a badminton court. This repository has beem created entirely for fun and for the sake of learning and showcasing real world solutions of automated skills.
